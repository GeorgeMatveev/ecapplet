Elliptic Curve Applet

This project is about Java implementation of various algorithms related to Elliptic Curve and its Cryptography (potentially). To get an idea about the subject matter, read these articles on Wikipedia:

Applet demonstrates how Triangulation of Elliptic Curve described in my paper

www.matveev.se/math/tec.htm

works in practice.

Applet aslo implements beta version of GYM (George Yury Matveev) algorithm for finding Rational points
on Trinagulated Elliptic curve. GYM algorithm is described in my paper "Rational points on Elliptic curve"

This is currently (March 2017) work in progress.
